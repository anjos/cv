  abstract = "Most of the research on vein biometrics addresses the problems of either palm or finger vein recognition with a considerably smaller emphasis on wrist vein modality. This paper paves the way to a better understanding of capabilities and challenges in the field of wrist vein verification. This is achieved by introducing and discussing a fully automatic cross-correlation based wrist vein verification technique. Overcoming the limitations of ordinary cross-correlation, the proposed system is capable of compensating for scale, translation and rotation between vein patterns in a computationally efficient way. Introduced comparison algorithm requires only two cross-correlation operations to compensate for both translation and rotation, moreover the well known property of log-polar transformation of Fourier magnitudes is not involved in any form. To emphasize the veins, a two-layer Hessian-based vein enhancement approach with adaptive brightness normalization is introduced, improving the connectivity and the stability of extracted vein patterns. The experiments on the publicly available PUT Vein wrist database give promising results with FNMR of 3.75\% for FMR of 0.1\%. In addition we make this research reproducible providing the source code and instructions to replicate all findings in this work.",

  abstract = "While face recognition systems got a significant boost in terms of recognition performance in recent years, they are known to be vulnerable to presentation attacks. Up to date, most of the research in the field of face anti-spoofing or presentation attack detection was considered as a two-class classification task: features of bona-fide samples versus features coming from spoofing attempts. The main focus has been on boosting the anti-spoofing performance for databases with identical types of attacks across both training and evaluation subsets. However, in realistic applications the types of attacks are likely to be unknown, potentially occupying a broad space in the feature domain. Therefore, a failure to generalize on unseen types of attacks is one of the main potential challenges in existing anti-spoofing approaches. First, to demonstrate the generalization issues of two-class anti-spoofing systems we establish new evaluation protocols for existing publicly available databases. Second, to unite the data collection efforts of various institutions we introduce a challenging Aggregated database composed of 3 publicly available datasets: Replay-Attack, Replay-Mobile and MSU MFSD, reporting the performance on it. Third, considering existing limitations we propose a number of systems approaching a task of presentation attack detection as an anomaly detection, or a one-class classification problem, using only bona-fide features in the training stage. Using less training data, hence requiring less effort in the data collection, the introduced approach demonstrates a better generalization properties against previously unseen types of attacks on the proposed Aggregated database.",

Most of the work published in this domain is assessed on privately-owned databases, making it difficult to evaluate proposed algorithms in a standard and principled manner. As a consequence, we present a new, publicly available database containing a relatively large number of subjects recorded under two different lighting conditions. Also, three state-of-the-art rPPG algorithms from the literature were selected, implemented and released as open source free software. After a thorough, unbiased experimental evaluation in various settings, it is shown that none of the selected algorithms is precise enough to be used in a real-world scenario.",

  abstract = "Pattern recognition and machine learning research work often contains experimental results on real-world data, which corroborates hypotheses and provides a canvas for the development and comparison of new ideas. Results, in this context, are typically summarized as a set of tables and figures, allowing the comparison of various methods, highlighting the advantages of the proposed ideas. Unfortunately, result reproducibility is often an overlooked feature of original research publications, competitions, or benchmark evaluations. The main reason for such a gap is the complexity on the development of software associated with these reports. Software frameworks are difficult to install, maintain, and distribute, while scientific experiments often consist of many steps and parameters that are difficult to report. The increasingly rising complexity of research challenges make it even more difficult to reproduce experiments and results. In this paper, we emphasize that a reproducible research work should be repeatable, shareable, extensible, and stable, and discuss important lessons we learned in creating, distributing, and maintaining software and data for reproducible research in pattern recognition and machine learning. We focus on a specific use-case of face recognition and describe in details how we can make the recognition experiments reproducible in practice.",

We cover the existing types of spoofing attacks and report on their success to bypass several state-of-the-art face recognition systems. The results on two different face spoofing databases in VIS and one newly developed face spoofing database in NIR show that spoofing attacks present a significant security risk for face recognition systems in any part of the spectrum. The risk is partially reduced when using multispectral systems. We also give a systematic overview of the existing anti-spoofing techniques, with an analysis of their advantages and limitations and prospective for future work.",

The database includes genuine and attacker keystroke sequences from 300 users acquired in 4 different sessions distributed in a four month time span. The sequences correspond to the user's name and surname and therefore each user comprises an individual and personal sequence. As baseline for KBOC we report the results of 31 different algorithms evaluated according to performance and robustness. The systems have achieved EERs as low as 5.32\% and high robustness against multisession variability with drop of performances lower than 1\% for probes separated by months. The entire database is publicly available at the competition website.",

Regardless of the biometric mode, the typical approach of anti-spoofing systems is to classify biometric evidence based on features discriminating between real accesses and spoofing attacks. For the first time, to the best of our knowledge, this paper studies the amount of client-specific information within these features and how it affects the performance of anti-spoofing systems. We make use of this information to build two client-specific anti-spoofing solutions, one relying on a generative and another one on a discriminative paradigm. The proposed methods, tested on a set of state-of-the-art anti-spoofing features for the face mode, outperform the client-independent approaches with up to 50\% relative improvement and exhibit better generalization capabilities on unseen types of spoofing attacks.",

Responding to this threat, numerous research publications address isolated spoofing detection, resulting in efficient counter-measures for many biometric modes. However, an important, but often overlooked issue regards their engagement into a verification task and how to measure their impact on the verification systems themselves. A novel evaluation framework for verification systems under spoofing attacks, called Expected Performance and Spoofability (EPS) framework, is the major contribution of this paper. Its purpose is to serve for an objective comparison of different verification systems with regards to their verification performance and vulnerability to spoofing, taking into account the system’s application-dependent susceptibility to spoofing attacks and cost of the errors. The convenience of the proposed open-source framework is demonstrated for the face mode, by comparing the security guarantee of four baseline face verification systems before and after they are secured with anti-spoofing algorithms.",

This paper introduces a novel and appealing approach to detect face spoofing using the spatiotemporal (dynamic texture) extensions of the highly popular local binary pattern operator. The key idea of the approach is to learn and detect the structure and the dynamics of the facial micro-textures that characterise real faces but not fake ones. We evaluated the approach with two publicly available databases (Replay-Attack Database and CASIA Face Anti-Spoofing Database). The results show that our approach performs better than state-of-the-art techniques following the provided evaluation protocols of each database.",
