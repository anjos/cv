# Curriculum Vitae of Andr√© Anjos

This package contains the source and build instructions for my CV. If you just want to
access it, use this link.  My CV and publication lists are auto-deployed to github-pages
at https://anjos.ai/cv/


## How to build from scratch

You need a full installation of LaTeX including the binaries `lualatex` and `biber`
(used via bibLaTeX) to compile these documents. On a macOS system, you can have a fully
equipped system by using homebrew and installing the `mactex` distribution:

```sh
$ brew install --cask mactex
```

You may then use `TexShop`, the built-in GUI for editing LaTeX files. If you'd
like to use the command-line to compile your sources, ensure to setup your
PATH, e.g.:

```sh
$ export PATH=/Library/TeX/texbin:$PATH
```


## Build

To compile the LaTeX sources, run `make`:

```sh
$ make
```
