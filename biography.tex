\section{Biography}

Andre Anjos received his Ph.D. degree in signal processing from the Federal
University of Rio de Janeiro in 2006. He joined the ATLAS Experiment at
European Centre for Particle Physics (CERN, Switzerland) from 2001 until 2010
where he worked in the development and deployment of the Trigger and Data
Acquisition systems that are nowadays powering the discovery of the Higgs
boson. During his time at CERN, while still associated with the Signal
Processing Laboratory at UFRJ, Andre studied the application of neural networks
and statistical methods for particle recognition at the trigger level and
developed several software components still in use today. In 2010, Andre joined
the Biometrics Group at the Idiap Research Institute where he works mostly with
biometrics. His current interests include reproducible research, biometrics
recognition using faces, pattern recognition, image processing and machine
learning.

Andre currently leads the design and implementation of the BEAT platform for
evaluation and testing. He also serves as reviewer for various scientific
journals in pattern recognition, image processing and biometrics.
